This is my first assignment with the Codeclause team as a Web development intern. This is a website I made for a premium reseller for Apple products, "Imagine", I have used my skills in html and css to make this website appealing to the users and also making it easier to use.
A heartfelt thank you to the CodeClause team for their trust and continuous support throughout this journey.
